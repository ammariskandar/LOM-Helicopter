# LOM-Helicopter
Low Order Model of a Helicopter with real physics (Blade Element Momentum Theory).
Still a work in progress. Started out as a university project, now I'm expanding on it as ahobby.
Right now the repository is a mess because I'm busy with exams, too busy to sort everything. But every file should be in here.
There might be irrelevant files in here too.
Contact me if you need anything. Ill get back as soon as possible.
